# Building A Computer
1. Whichis better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true: How many CPU cores does a computer need?

   The higher the processors speed (inGHz) the faster it can process data. If you load lots of software and run multiple programs simultaneously, you want more cores. If you play processor heavy gaming or run programs that use huge amounts of information at a quick speed, then you want higher speed fewer cores. The amount of cores a computer needs depends on the use of the computer. The more intense the task of the computers use, the more cores it needs.

2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?

   Checking the socket of the CPU and motherboard. Also make sure there is onboard wifi, high RAM capacity, and support for graphic cards.

3. What are the trade offs you'd evaluate while selecting a storage device?

   Size and speed. The SSD is smaller and faster than HDD's.

4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts in a way they's best connect with?

   I would compare it the key parts of a computer to football. Explain how the owner of the team is the mother board, but in order for the motherboard to make everything operate correctly it takes a team.
